# Team Components Documentation

This directory contains a comprehensive set of React components for displaying team member information in a professional, accessible, and performant manner.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The team page follows a modular, component-based architecture with the following principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Data, UI components, and business logic are cleanly separated
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimized with React best practices including memoization and lazy loading
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with fluid layouts
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and graceful failure states

## 🔧 Components

### TeamSection

The main orchestrator component that manages state and coordinates all other team components.

**Features:**

- Centralized state management
- Error boundary integration
- Suspense support for loading states
- Memoized callbacks for performance

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { TeamSection } from "@/components/team";

export default function TeamPage() {
  return <TeamSection />;
}
```

### TeamGrid

Responsive grid layout component that displays team member cards with staggered animations.

**Features:**

- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Staggered entrance animations
- Empty state handling
- Performance optimized with useMemo

### TeamMemberCard

Individual team member card with hover effects and accessibility features.

**Features:**

- Smooth hover animations
- Keyboard navigation support
- Optimized image loading with Next.js Image
- Focus management and ARIA labels
- Department badges

### TeamMemberModal

Modal component for displaying detailed team member information.

**Features:**

- Social media links with icons
- Responsive layout
- Proper modal semantics
- External link indicators
- Keyboard accessible

### TeamHeader

Animated header section with title and description.

**Features:**

- Gradient text effects
- Smooth entrance animations
- Customizable content
- SEO-friendly heading structure

## 🎨 Styling and Theming

The components use Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for consistent theming:

- **Color Palette**: Uses semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with proper contrast ratios
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with fluid typography and spacing
- **Animations**: Performance-optimized CSS transforms and Framer Motion

## 🔄 State Management

### useTeam Hook

Custom hook providing team-related state and operations:

```tsx
const {
  members,
  selectedMember,
  isLoading,
  error,
  selectMember,
  clearSelection,
  activeMembers,
  memberById,
  membersByDepartment,
} = useTeam();
```

## 📊 Data Structure

### TeamMember Interface

```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  readonly id: number;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly role: string;
  readonly department: Department;
  readonly image: string;
  readonly bio: string;
  readonly social: SocialLinks;
  readonly isActive?: boolean;
}
```

### Department Types

```typescript
type Department =
  | "Administrative"
  | "Data Science"
  | "Web Development"
  | "Project Management"
  | "Other";
```

## ✨ Animations

Animation system built with Framer Motion for smooth, performant transitions:

- **Staggered Animations**: Cards animate in sequence for visual hierarchy
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scale and elevation changes
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth entrance animations
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms only

### Animation Variants

```typescript
export const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.9, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, scale: 1, y: 0 },
};
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling strategy:

- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and handle React errors gracefully
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and spinners
- **Empty States**: Meaningful messages when no data is available
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms and user feedback

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with proper focus management
- **Screen Readers**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color ratios
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Components are lazily loaded
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with priority loading
- **Memoization**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate
- **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking friendly exports
- **Animation Performance**: GPU-accelerated transforms only

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

When testing these components, consider:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual component props and behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and state management
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Regression**: Test responsive layouts and animations
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor animation performance and bundle size

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Team Members

Update the `TEAM_MEMBERS` array in `lib/team-data.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 10,
  name: "New Member",
  role: "Software Engineer",
  department: "Web Development",
  image: "/assets/team/new-member.jpg",
  bio: "Bio description...",
  social: {
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/newmember"
  },
  isActive: true
}
```

### Customizing Animations

Modify animation variants in `lib/animations.ts`:

```typescript
export const customVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
};
```

### Theme Customization

Update CSS variables in `app/globals.css` or component-specific styles.
